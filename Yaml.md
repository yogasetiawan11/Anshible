## What is Yaml
YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language.
It’s often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.

For example, suppose you are writing a Python app that needs an input such as a simple list of users.
Instead of hardcoding the data or using a database, you can write that list in a YAML file and load it into your Python application.

This way, YAML helps you pass structured data (like lists, dictionaries) to your Python app in a clean, readable format.

In the same case you can also use some alternative like json and txt. 

But Yaml has its own advantage that is readable format.
