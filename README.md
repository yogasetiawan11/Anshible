# What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool used to configure systems, deploy software, and manage infrastructure as code. 
It helps automate repetitive tasks across many servers with simple commands.

Ansible works by connecting to your nodes (servers, VMs, or containers) over SSH and pushing out small programs called modules that do the actual work.
